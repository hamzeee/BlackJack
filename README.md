# BlackJack

A version of the game BlackJack with the a dealer and a single player

The goal is to get to 21, where each card has points equal to its number

Face cards have a point of 10

Aces have a value of 1 or 11 which you can choose in the game

You have limited funds and can play as long as they aren't empty

Each turn you can either "Hit' yourself with a new card or 'Stay' after which the dealer plays until one of you wins

Have fun!
